<p><i> Welcome to my webpage. My name is Joel Renaldo Anderson. I was born in Kingston, Jamaica, on the 19<sup>th</sup> of October, 2003, to my mother, Jacqueline Miller and my father, 
Wayne Anderson. I have 2 brothers, Matthew Anderson, the older, and Dejaun Anderson, the younger. I have attended the WonderWorld school, Elim Basic School, New Day Primary and Junior High School, 
Ardenne High, Pre-University School, and now currently the University of Technology. I am aiming to attend a Canadian University next year, and to live and work in that country.]
The other pages on this website will give you a more in depth look at my life and who I am as a person. </p>
